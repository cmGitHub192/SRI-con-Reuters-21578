# Information Retrieval System based on Reuters-21578

## Project Description

This project focuses on developing an Information Retrieval System (IRS) using the Reuters-21578 corpus, a dataset widely used in information retrieval research. The main goal is to implement a system that allows efficient and accurate searches within the corpus, using modern text processing techniques and search algorithms.

## Context and Motivation

Information retrieval is a key area in data science and artificial intelligence, enabling the extraction of relevant information from large volumes of unstructured data. The Reuters-21578 corpus contains thousands of news articles, making it ideal for experimenting with and evaluating various text processing and search techniques.

## Specific Objectives

1. **Data Acquisition and Preparation**: Download, decompress, and organize the Reuters-21578 corpus files.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data, remove unwanted characters, tokenize the text, and apply stemming and lemmatization.
3. **Text Vectorization**: Convert texts into numerical vectors using techniques like Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF.
4. **Indexing**: Build an inverted index to enable fast and efficient searches.
5. **Search Engine Implementation**: Develop logic to process queries and rank results using similarity algorithms such as cosine similarity and Jaccard.
6. **System Evaluation**: Measure system effectiveness using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
7. **User Interface**: Create an intuitive web interface to allow users to interact with the system and perform searches.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data preprocessing and search engine development.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the web interface.
- **Python Libraries**: Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, among others.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Acquisition**:
   - Download the Reuters-21578 corpus.
   - Decompress and organize the files.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Extract relevant content from the documents.
   - Clean and normalize the text.
   - Tokenize, remove stop words, and apply stemming or lemmatization.

3. **Vector Representation**:
   - Vectorize the texts using techniques like BoW and TF-IDF.
   - Evaluate the vectorization techniques.

4. **Indexing**:
   - Build an inverted index to map terms to documents.
   - Optimize data structures for the index.

5. **Search Engine Design**:
   - Develop logic to process user queries.
   - Implement similarity and ranking algorithms.

6. **System Evaluation**:
   - Define evaluation metrics.
   - Test with the corpus’ test set and analyze results.

7. **Web User Interface**:
   - Design and develop a web interface for users to perform searches.
   - Implement features like filters and display options.

## Expected Results

By the end of the project, a functional IRS is expected that will allow efficient searches in the Reuters-21578 corpus. The system’s evaluation should demonstrate high precision and recall, indicating the effectiveness of the IRS.

## Conclusion

This project offers a practical opportunity to apply and enhance skills in natural language processing, information retrieval, and web application development. It also contributes to the understanding and application of advanced techniques for managing large textual datasets.
